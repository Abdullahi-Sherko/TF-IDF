Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements.        Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific         main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay
the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph.        Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function.         But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity.
An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis,        whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence.
